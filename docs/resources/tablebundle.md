# Table Bundle

The Table Bundle is a high-level organizing resource that brings together all of the component resources to fully materialize tables for analytic use. This can include a base data table (e.g., CSV or JSON data file), a [Codebook](./codebook.md) that defines the schema, and a [Workflow](./workflow.md) defining transformations to apply.
