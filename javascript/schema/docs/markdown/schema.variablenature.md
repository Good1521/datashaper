## VariableNature enum

Describes the semantic shape of a variable. This has particular effect on how we display and compare data, such as using line charts for continuous versus bar charts for categorical. This mostly applies to numeric variables, but strings for instance can be categorial.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare enum VariableNature 
```

## Enumeration Members

|  Member | Value | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  Binary | <code>&quot;binary&quot;</code> | Only two valid values are allowed, commonly 1 = true, 0 = false. If the data type for a column is boolean, this will be the nature. If only two unique strings are present, this will be the nature (e.g., 'Y' and 'N') |
|  Continuous | <code>&quot;continuous&quot;</code> | Continuously variable, i.e., decimal. |
|  Discrete | <code>&quot;discrete&quot;</code> | Discrete intervals, i.e., whole numbers. |
|  Nominal | <code>&quot;nominal&quot;</code> | <p>Integers mapped to arbitrary categories where order does not matter. String columns are also normally nominal. For example:</p><p>Eye color 0: Unknown/missing 1: Green 2: Blue 3: Brown 4: Hazel ...</p> |
|  Ordinal | <code>&quot;ordinal&quot;</code> | <p>Integers map to ordered categories. The order matters here because it can be used to indicate progression. For example:</p><p>Income 0: Unknown/missing 1: No income 2: 1-9999 3: 10000-19999 4: 20000-29999 ...</p><p>In this case the integer category carries an indication of escalating income range.</p> |
