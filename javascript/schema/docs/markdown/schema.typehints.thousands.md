## TypeHints.thousands property

For large numbers that have been written with a thousands separator, you can set the thousands keyword to a string of length 1 so that integers will be parsed correctly. By default, numbers with a thousands separator will be parsed as strings. Default: none.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
thousands?: string;
```
