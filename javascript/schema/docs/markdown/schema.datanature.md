## DataNature enum

Indicates the expected general layout of the data. This could be used to provide validation hints. For example, microdata must have one row per subject. TODO: "timeseries" as distinct from "panel"? others?

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare enum DataNature 
```

## Enumeration Members

|  Member | Value | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  Micro | <code>&quot;micro&quot;</code> | Each row refers to a single subject. An example is a database of records about a person (name, address, etc.) |
|  Panel | <code>&quot;panel&quot;</code> | Rows refer to measurements over time of a group. An example is aggregate yearly smoking data for each US state. |
