# schema

This package contains TypeScript types for all of our core resource definitions. This includes data packages, table describing schemas, verbs and their arguments, and so on. This package also contains JSONSchema-generating build steps that convert the TypeScript types to formal JSONSchema that is ready for publication and use with validators, etc.
