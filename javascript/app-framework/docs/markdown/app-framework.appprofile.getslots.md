## AppProfile.getSlots property

Profiles can indicate what child profiles they can support. These will be added as "field wells" to be filled in. If a slot is not filled, it will render a dropdown that shows the list of all matching profile resources in the current package.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
getSlots?: (resource: Res) => ResourceSlotFieldWell[];
```
